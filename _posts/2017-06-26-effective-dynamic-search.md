Research on exploratory search has been supported by several initiatives. The Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) have hosted related research tracks on interactive search, search within sessions, search for task completion and, more recently, dynamic search in specialized domains organized mainly by Grace Hui Yang and Ian Saboroff.  The latter problem, embodied by the TREC Dynamic Domain track, was the focus of my Master supervised by Rodrygo Santos.
