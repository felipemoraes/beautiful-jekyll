title: Information Flow in Dynamic Information Retrieval
---
Back in 2016, I decided to take an Information Theory course at UFMG lectured by Mário S. Alvim. As part of the course, Mário asks his students to write and present about specific topic in information theory (not covered by him along the semester) or to model a speficic topic in our research area. I tried the latter, however, I chose a topic of Mário expertise, information flow and I wrote a short report in how we could model information flow in information retrieval. 

Months later, Mário and I reviewed the report and together with my Master's supervisor, Rodrygo Santos, we decide to make this modeling available to the IR community. Thus, we got this study accepted as a short paper at ICTIR 2017:
