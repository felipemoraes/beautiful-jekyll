I am a PhD candidate in Information Retrieval in the Web Information System group at the Delft University of Technology under the supervision of Claudia Hauff. I hold BSc and MSc degree in Computer Science (supervised by Rodrygo Santos) from the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG). I was a Mitacs Globalink research intern in 2014 at the Université de Québec à Montréal (UQAM) and visiting researcher at the Visualization and Data Analysis Laboratory (ViDA) of the New York University.
